--Problem Statement

/*
Given a table TRIANGLES that holds data for three fields namely A, B, C.
+-------------+------------+
| Column      |   Type     |
+-------------+------------+
| A           | INTEGER    |
| B           | INTEGER    |
| C           | INTEGER    |
+-------------+------------+
 
Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral   : It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles     : It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene       : It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
*/

Solution:

-- Start of the SELECT statement with CASE expression
SELECT CASE 
    -- First condition: Check if any two sides of the triangle sum to less than or equal to the length of the third side
    WHEN A+B <= C OR A+C <= B OR B+C <= A THEN "Not A Triangle"
    
    -- Second condition: Check if all three sides are equal, indicating an Equilateral triangle
    WHEN A=B AND B=C THEN "Equilateral"
    
    -- Third condition: Check if at least two sides are equal, indicating an Isosceles triangle
    WHEN A=B OR B=C OR C=A THEN "Isosceles"
    
    -- If none of the above conditions are met, it's a Scalene triangle with all sides different
    ELSE 'Scalene'
END
-- End of the CASE expression
FROM TRIANGLES;  -- Data is retrieved from the TRIANGLES table to perform the classification.
